=== Syntax Parser ===
	A program that reads your code and determines what it does and if its grammar is valid.


=== Lexical Environment ===
	Where something sits physically in the code you write.
	'Lexical' means 'having to do with words or grammar'. A lexical environment exists in programming languages in which WHERE you write something is important. 
	Not every language works that way.

function hello() {
    var a = 'hello world';
}

The variable 'a' sits lexically in the function hello.
So when we talk about the lexical environment we talk about where something is written and what surrounds it.


=== Execution Context ===
	A wrapper to help manage the code that is running.
	There are lots of lexical environment. Which one is currently running is managed via execution contexts. It contain things beyond what you've written in your code.
	The base execution context is the global execution context.
	It creates the Global Object and the variable 'this'


=== A Name/Value pair ===
	A name which maps to a unique value.
	The name may be defined more than once, but only can have one value in any given context.
	That value may be more name/value pairs.

Address = '100 Street' // address is name and '100 Street' is value

In JavaScript an object is just simply a collection of name/value pairs. 

Address:
{
    Street: 'Main', // Street is a name and 'Main its a value 
    Number: '100,
    Apartment: // apartment is a name and its value is a collection
    {
        Floor: 3,
        Number: 303
    }
}
