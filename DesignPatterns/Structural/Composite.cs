		Motivation:
		Objects use other objects' fields/properties/members through inheritance and composition.
		Composite lets us make compound objects e.g. a group of shapes that consist other shapes.
		Composite design pattern is used to treat both single (scalar) and composite objects uniformly.

		Definition:
		A mechanism for treating individual (scalar) objects and compositions of objects in a uniform manner.
