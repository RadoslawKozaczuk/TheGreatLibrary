		Motivation:
		Electrical devices have different power (interface) requirements.
		We cannot modify our gadgets to support every possible interface.
		Thus, we use a special device (an adapter) to give us the interface we require from the interface we have.

		Definition:
		A construct which adapts an existing interface X to conform to the required interface Y.
